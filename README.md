# ER Flow Accelerator App

## Overview
Our project is a digital ER app that finds the nearest hospitals, shows real-time wait times, summarizes patient information, supports multiple languages, and dramatically speeds up the intake process. By allowing patients to complete a structured assessment immediately upon arrival, the app provides medical staff with instant access to symptom data and medical history—eliminating delays before first triage. 

This accelerates diagnosis, improves bed turnover, and reduces congestion without requiring additional staff or infrastructure. In short, we streamline ER flow from arrival to treatment, improving patient outcomes and system efficiency.

Our project is an ER app that finds the nearest hospitals, displays wait times, summarizes patient information, supports multiple languages, and streamlines care. When you open the link to our project, it will take you to a demo page. Click **TryGemini Canvas** on the bottom right to see all of our code. If that does not work, all of our code is on our GitHub in a `.txt` file.

## Features
- **Supports _multiple languages_** for diverse patient populations
- **Shows _hospital wait times_ and _bed availability_** in real-time
- **_Summarizes patient info_** for nurses and doctors
- **Speeds up care by _reducing delays_** before triage
- **Easy access to patient data** for medical staff

---

## How It Works
1. **Patient Arrival**: Patient opens the app and completes a structured intake form.
2. **Data Collection**: Symptoms, medical history, and social/support info are summarized.
3. **Instant Access for Staff**: Nurses and doctors receive the summary instantly for faster triage and diagnosis.
4. **Optimized ER Flow**: Freed-up beds and faster diagnosis reduce congestion and improve overall patient outcomes.

## Summary
Our ER app finds the nearest hospitals, displays wait times, summarizes patient information, supports multiple languages, and streamlines care. It streamlines ER flow from arrival to treatment, improving efficiency and patient outcomes.
